C++ modules for 42 coding school

The CPP (C++ programming) modules are a series of programming projects assigned by 42 coding school. The projects cover various topics in C++ programming, such as object-oriented programming, templates, and standard template library (STL) containers. The modules are designed to build upon each other, with each module introducing new concepts and building on the previous modules. The projects require students to implement different features and programs using C++, such as creating a class hierarchy, implementing a generic container, and building a program using the STL algorithms. The projects also focus on best practices in C++ programming, such as memory management and exception handling. Students are required to write clean, efficient, and well-structured code and to follow the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. The CPP modules test the students' understanding of advanced programming concepts and their ability to apply them to real-world programming problems
